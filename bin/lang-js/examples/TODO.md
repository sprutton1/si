# TODO

At the time of this file's creation, the existing examples did not work. The
[README](../README.md) has been updated to be generic for any example in its
guide.

We should create new examples for testing `lang-js` locally without the entire
stack. For now, use `dal` integration tests for `lang-js` testing or add new
examples to this directory and delete this `TODO.md` file.

See [PR #4259](https://github.com/systeminit/si/pull/4259) for more information.
